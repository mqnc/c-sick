Operator precedence is mainly inspired by c++ except that bitwise operators have now higher precedence than comparisons like in python and as it should be

For the ternary operator I am still unsure about the best way:

1) sign := -1 if x<0 else 1 if x>0 else 0
2) sign := x<0 ? -1 : x>0 ? 1 : 0
3) sign := when x<0 then -1 elseif x>0 then 1 else 0
4) sign := {-1 if x<0, 1 if x>0, 0 otherwise

1 is Python but for some reason I don't really like that the condition is between the options and I am not sure the parser can always distinguish it from a normal if branch thing
2 is traditional and probably well established but it looks confusing for noobs and cinnemon is all about intuitive readability
3 would be a new thing
4 is beautifully mathematical but it blocks the { (which so far doesn't have another meaning but then maybe we can't have {}) and "otherwise" is a pretty long word
