for debugging, it would be nice to just add @ at the beginning of the line (contianing an expression or assignment) and then debug output is generated
@ because it looks like a breakpoint
we could optionally require a key press

// @ x := f(t)
std::cout << "x := f(t) --> "
waitkey();
x = f(t);
std::cout << x << "\n"

// @ g(u)
std::cout << "g(u) --> "
waitkey();
std::cout << g(u) << "\n"

so @ is a break point
does it wait for input?
does it just print a single word?
does it print both the expression and the evaluation?
is all of it removed in non #define DEBUG mode?

// @ "here" // just the value
cout << "here" << "\n"

// @$ "here" // just the value and requires input

@$// I stop
I stop [press any key]
@// I don't
I don't
@ a := b + c
a := b + c <-- 17
@ f(x)
f(x) <-- 23
@@ a + b //I am a pure debug thing that only gets done in debug mode
a + b //I am a pure debug thing that only gets done in debug mode <-- 521
@$(
// every line here is debug moded
a + b = 7
)@ <- wait for input
