new structure for the transpiler:

the integer accessors contain the values directly

.txt contains the text that is handed upwards the tree

the rest is up to the specific function

top-level rules call cpp/h/log/doc generators



this is how the function rule learns about an inner return statement:

when the "function" keyword is parsed, it appends a nil to some global function stack

if a return keyword is successfully parsed (meaning there was definitely a function declaration),
it writes into the last element of that stack

the "endfunction" keyword parsement reads from this stack and hands the result up to the function rule

this will also be useful for scoped stuff and maybe we can register variables and so on
